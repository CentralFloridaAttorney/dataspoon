# Learn Tkinter By Example
Learn Tkinter By Example - a free book for learning tkinter, complete with full source code.

[Get the book here](Tkinter-By-Example.pdf)

Mobile formats ([mobi](assets/Tkinter-By-Example.mobi) and [epub](assets/Tkinter-By-Example.epub)) are now available in the [assets](assets) folder. However, I would recommend using [FBReader](https://fbreader.org) with the PDF version where possible. 

## What's This Book About?

This book walks you through 7 full-featured applications built with Python and Tkinter. Each application will teach you different aspects of Tkinter which you can use for your own projects. Screenshots, source code and full explanations are included with each app.

The book assumes little-to-no experience with tkinter but will require some basic knowledge of the Python language. 

Full source code of each application is available in the Code folder of this repository. The Latex source of the book itself is in the assets folder.
